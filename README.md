# Tunicus-Placement-v3
This is a major modification to the Tunicus placement v2 module that makes many additions to a well known and frequently used grid placement system for sandbox tycoons in Roblox.

This repository comes with a .rbxl file. If you open the file with Roblox Studio, you will find a StarterGui TextButton and LocalScript, a placement ModuleScript inside ReplicatedStorage, and a placement Script inside ServerScriptService. The server script comes with placement protections such as placing inside of already placed objects, placing outside the baseplate, placing up high off of platforms, placing objects inside of each other etc.
